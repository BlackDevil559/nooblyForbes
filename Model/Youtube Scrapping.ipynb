       " \"hello and welcome to storyboard I'm shibani garat in a special chat naven kka CEO of essence Media Com South Asia speaks about the year gone by for this youngest agency under group M what is the action expected around the festival season and as the healthy competition within the top three groupm agencies mind share V maker and Essence Mediacom continues where does Essence Mediacom stand in terms of rankings and new business Acquisitions listen in naen uh you know it's been um like more than a year since you know the merger happened between Essence and Mediacom since you took charge of uh the newest agency and the youngest agency under group M uh tell us how have you brought all the pieces together the people the business streamlining of clients how have you done it how does the agency look like now if you see some of the scores that we've got so today if you if if you see the uh the latest walk rankings that have come out uh globally two of my offices today uh sence Mediacom Mumbai Office and sence Mediacom guro office have been ranked number five and number nine globally so that speaks a lot about the volume of work you know that we are doing for our clients and the type of work that we are doing for our clients uh so that's one the second thing is I would say uh we haven't lost a single client and given mergers you know what happens there's a lot of uh you know changes happening internally externally you have less focus on clients you try to manage of people but we haven't lost a single client and we've only added about I would say about 20 new clients in the last 17 18 months about I would say about2 million of new business that we've added about 1,500 1600 crores so that's great progress that we've shown from where we were and also if you see globally as for the latest convergence data asence Mediacom was ranked number one after the merger so we are the number one ranked agency globally and in India for the first time huh we are ranked within the top three agencies in the country and uh and all the top three agencies in in India as you know our groupm agencies so such a fortunate place to be for us as as groupm in India and as Essence media com to be in such a such a position that we are in today very strong and uh and growing really fast how was the uh first half of 2024 what were the Billings like we are almost 10 to 12 billion dollar in terms of our Billings today huh and we are growing the I think the fastest growing agency our building growth is almost 10 to 12% our cagr is about 133% in The Last 5 Years also um if you see my digital mix in my in my billing is 57% which is again the highest amongst the top five agencies in the country so if you see all these indicators are showing that we are growing my digital mix is the highest and we are getting new clients which obviously means that we are really a youngest agency huh poised for being a what what should I say I think a very Future Ready mindset we already in the second half of the year uh we are in the thick of the festival season what are your expectations going forward how will it fair as compared to like the previous Festival that we saw which was like a really long yeah I think it's a great question because I think we are coming at the back of a of a very uh uh High festive quarter of last year and that was nothing because a lot of categories were coming back and and also because there was the World Cup Cricket happening and the World Cup ret was happening in the last two years in fact but last year the World Cup Cricket happened actually in India and it was a 50 over format the 50 over format is a larger format for more advertising more room for more money to come in and so on and so forth so this year given that we are already on the back of a large base of last year I think uh uh I think we are expecting to see about a 6 and a half 7% growth over last year while the addex this year if you see we are looking to grow at about 9 and a half 10% if you look at the latest group mty Andy estimates yes the addex will not grow on the yearly average but on the on the overall existing base of last year it is growing at about 6 and a half 7% also this quarter is almost uh what should I say about 33 to 35% of the entire adct is dependent on this quarter which is I would say mid September to mid December right if you look at practically the festival season so so so almost 50,000 crores of addicts is actually riding on this quarter and because of that this quarter therefore becomes very important for advertisers for for media houses uh for the entire consumer sentiment in the country and so on and so forth so therefore yeah we are um we are looking at about 6 to 7% growth is what I would say cautious optimism is a term that I think is overused and abused these days over the past couple of months I'm hearing it a lot from uh media buying agencies I'm hearing it a lot from some of the marketers that you know I'm speaking to so tell us naen how are they spending I think are they spending yes of course I think I think the worst is behind us while I know we've revised our T NY estimates downwards this year you know we were expecting more than 10% we revised it to 9 and a half% in our in our June in our June numbers but yes I think the worst is behind us and the two reasons why I say that the the indicators that we are seeing right now the rural recovery is on its way back fmcg uh is is is on it on its track of spending money again if you look at Auto auto if you look at if you look at the EV sector they've announced huge price Cuts right now that is expected to boost the EV sector which also becoming very big if you look at the the inventory pile up that has come in the auto sector they are wanting to get rid of their inventory but already starting to offer great discounts great promotions on that so these are all indicators huh that the market will look up in the next two three months companies will want to give uh entice the consumer huh with offers with with promotions and whatever indicators that we are getting from our Commerce Partners saying companies like you know categories like mobile handset or home decor uh home appliances they are saying that all these categories we last year did not see such a huge huge growth this year they're expecting to see almost a 10% jump over last year so I I would say the all these indicators clearly showing and pointing out uhuh that this Festival season I think uh will be far better than what caution optimism that people are talking about you know sticking with the phrase how does naven kka evaluate this phrase cautious optimism how what is your evaluation of I would say uh my sense would be uh to to advise clients huh advise clients to not be over cautious uhuh to look at the data very uh subjectively and to be able to design campaigns and to be able to put the right Investments so that they're able to reap the benefits because let me tell you the festival season is what give or to it to 10 weeks in these 8 to 10 weeks if you not able to get it righted then that sale is gone forever uh so what is important here right now so what I tell them is uh uh is uh the category clutter you know there's also a lot of clutter in this as lot of advertisers lot of categories so we tell them you please look at the Clutter that is there in the season look at your category clutter that is there in the season look at what your competition is doing look at what what the competing brands are offering in terms of the discounts the promotions the the the the other the offers that they giving to the consumers and then you have to be comparative enough and if you have a compelling proposition go ahead and do that media investment it'll give you the returns so yeah you need to be very well prepared and as I said the window is very short so therefore you need to be by now you should be well planned where is your focus set out for you know the next uh few months as we step into uh 2025 last year when we met around this time uh you said you know you want to be the number one agency under group M so watch out wav maker and watch out mind share so I think uh yeah I think we I think we've done well we've done well and we are top three brands and uh I would continue to strive to become number two well easier said than done it's not so easy uh there's great competition sitting and um I would say the greatest opportunity as I said uh would be harnessing this uh new startup ecoystem that is coming up huh that's a great opportunity as far as what I would want to focus on it's a really Resurgence of the startup economy I want to focus on that and I would say the any challenge I would say is today the the only challenge that we face today is to be able to upskill our Manpower because the transformation is the buzz word today right every client office that you go to internally also every employee wants to transform himself for herself for the new age so to be able to upskill them to be able to Res skill them is something that I want to also invest a lot of time in so that uh it's not only for the short term we are able to build a great organization which you know uh I mean is top agency in the next three to five years I guess for for the future yeah so the competitive stance continues of course of course when I spoke to PK at the start of the year he said there is healthy competition but it's good for uh group M overall of course of course I think uh I think it's a great team and uh this collaboration is what has got us still here and I think it's our Collective effort and the collective collaboration that we do will uh will take us into the

part of walking through the factory today and touring it we're seeing that the humans who are working in it where we've created these jobs it it really is fascin it's phenomenal uh looking seeing the products that we're building here and uh and thinking about the future and everything that we can do here it's just very exciting but the teams have done a good job getting us to this point we're excited about it we're we're obviously going to use this both domestically and for an export Hub so we think there's a bright future and a lot of Runway here is 2025 going to be a big year for m&a as well we're very happy with the Splunk acquisition you know if you think about it in a nutshell to to to be a great networking company you have to be a great security company to be a great security company you're going to have to be a great AI company and to be a great AI company you're going to have to be a great data company and we are the only company in the world that has all four of those

Chuck uh you know potential for India from an m&a point of view you talked about data you talked about security and we've got a bunch of startups operating in that space is uh is is there anything exciting on that front from an India perspective the exciting thing on the startup front in India is that it's expanding rapidly and uh there is a lot of focus on the very areas that are important to us if my memory serves me correctly I think we've made five Acquisitions here and we have we launched a billion dollar AI fund to actually invest in AI startups and I would suspect that there' be lots

between insurers and hospitals to give customers an amazing claims experience here's bunel speaking exclusively to CNBC TV8 Shireen ban about where things stand on that front and what else could be in store are you getting into the hospital business uh so see we we very very firmly believe that's a very important need for middle class India today uh the sort of overtreatment which happen in the hospitals the frauds which can come into this any person walking into a hospital is a revenue for the hospital but it's a cost for the insurance company so unless that part is controlled the consumer trust and we talking about middle class India yeah the consumer trust for that segment will not come and unless that consumer trust is not there they will not come to buy and even if they come to buy they will not buy they will just look at the options and go away but but getting into the asset management no it's not Asset Management it's the experience management asset can be owned by anyone it doesn't really matter but the experience has to be controlled by someone who understands the customer needs and the customer pain points has has the uh investor reaction startled you surprised you rattled you are you are you reconsidering the plan no no no no not at all see sh if you think about it we sort of started talking about it about four five months ago yeah the share price actually

allow companies to engage interns across their supply chain and as well as their group companies but the certification of the internship will have to come from the main company this sources say is to keep the corporates invested in the progress of the of the interns and with this the MCA is also asking corporates that all the roles given to these interns should be skill-based not menial at all

utilized from the CSR fund apart from this a monthly sent of 500 rupees will be given to the interns from the CSR fund and 4500 as we know from the government totaling to a 5,000 rupees per intern per month the government will also provide as we know one time additional time payment of 6,000 Rupees to the interns now the internship portal that will also go live in a week is likely to match

at the strike nears its third week it's been two weeks since Boeing factory workers in that region have been striking for the first time in 16 years the union of 33,000 workers is originally demanding a 40% pay hike over 3 years Boeing has so far made two offers to the Striking workers they rejected the initial offer of a 25% pay increase and the first round of mediat talks broke down last week without a deal being reached the plane maker then made what it called its best and final offer of a 30% raise in pay over 4 years direct to the workers which infuriated union leaders who slamed the attempt to bypass them as disrespectful boing however said that its last offer would take the average annual pay for Machinist from about $75,600 now to $11.11 lakh at the end of the 4-year contract it would also keep annual bonuses based on productivity when in the rejected offer uh Boeing sought to replace those payouts with new contributions to retirement accounts but following the Union's opposition to the offer going back down Tuesday and gave the union more time to consider the new proposal however many workers said that the company's latest offer wasn't good enough considering the increased living cost since the last negotiation 16 years ago noting that the only way to resolve the strike is through negotiations a regional district of the International Association of machinist and Aerospace workers said that the two sides would meet again today to discuss the matter alongside Federal mediators now the impact of the strike is that it has led to a shutdown of production of Boeing 737s 767s and 777s it has also led the company to make cost cutting moves including rolling temporary fur lows for thousands of non-union managers and employees right keska thanks a lot for

quick Commerce boom a special report in just a bate and you can also catch all CNBC TV1 18's news and updates on Facebook X threads Instagram and geoc Cinema now Israel has rejected Global calls for a

Community to stop supplying weapons to Israel and also laid out a 12-point road map for post-ww war management more than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the War Began in October of 2023 well back home quick Commerce has changed the way people shop the convenience it offers is increasingly making old school convenience stores or kirana stores redundant in the second part of CNBC TV8 series it by it CNBC TV8 Shilpa Rani Peta reports that many of India's 30 million kirana stores are struggling to stay [Music] alive India's consumers are an impatient lot and India's ubiquitous neighborhood kirana stores are losing business first quick Commerce platforms took away the forgetful absent-minded customer who popped into stores for some last minute purchases and now increasingly even the regulars who drop by once a week or once a month for their planned purchases are choosing to let their fingers do the walking reports suggest the rapid rise of quick Commerce platforms has taken away 25 to 30% of the business kirana stores could boast and Industry bodies claim nearly 25% of India's 30 million kirana stores are on the verge of shutting shop the when these competitors are entered so now what has happened is customer's mindset and customer itself has the Habit the practice of them ordering grocery has changed completely so what has happened even if they want to order say 200 rupee uh 200 rupee item or 300 rupe item they want quick delivery and this is the Habit which is which is what uh where we are facing a big competition over the last two years uh these kirana stores have seen a significant negative impact because ofcommerce forms where there's impulse buying for certain kind of products those are things you know which are bought from the kirana stores or probably you know somebody would go and pick them up but I think because of the convenience that quick Commerce offers uh this is you know kind of hampered growth for kirana stores in the Metro cities and if at all quick Commerce scales up beyond the Metro cities they go to tier two and tier three markets and if at all they able to attain success there as well you will see a bigger negative impact for kirana stores as a whole it's not just the ease of ordering and the speed of delivery that has worked in Ecommerce favor it's the discounts on offer which kirana stores are unable to match for kirana stores costs are also mounting the margins offered by fmcg manufacturers has dropped to 10 to 12% lower than the 18 to 20% they got before the covid-19 pandemic establishment costs and stockholding costs are also Rising something QC Commerce platforms are able to offset with scale the profit margin of a kirana store is not more than 5 to 10% of a % to the max one primary concern and issue what we are thinking is that increasing control of with Commerce platform over their products on distribution in a primary case in many cases a single platform assume full control over sales and distribution of a product the all India consumer products distribution Association has filed a complaint with the Commerce Ministry raising concerns over the threat of quick Commerce and alleging a host of missteps including violation of FDI Norms some kirana stores meanwhile have chosen to innovate and try to fight for survival these range from trying to connect with consumers via WhatsApp to spruing up their stores and widening products on offer to integrating billing and backend systems using technology we have also tried to slowly gradually change our modules store was always an offline store uh since now we have also started little bit of online if you have seen the traditional store what in olden times it used to be more brighter the displays have changed what I see that a personal people who requires a personal service will definitely come to the stores but these Innovations come with costs attached and it's not something every store is able to afford so while Kiran stores try to put their head above the water they're hoping that familiarity trust and the need for touch and feel will keep bringing the regular customers to their stores and that will help keep the lights on for now but they say that without government Intervention which could be in the form of protectionist policies or easier access to funding for Tech upgradation long-term survival is still not in the basket in Mumbai sharani paa and with that it's a wrap on this edition of India business are thank you so much for watching news and updates will continue right here on CNBC TV8\",\n",

       " \"hello and welcome to Global ey I'm parit lutra in a warning to the Western Nations Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia would use its nuclear Arsenal if it was struck with conventional missiles by Ukraine he added that Moscow would consider it to be a joint attack if any of the western nuclear poers supported the missile attacks by Ukraine a non-nuclear nation Putin's comments and threats come on the back of reports that ke was seeking the approval of the United States and UK to use long range Western missiles against Russia the updated version of the document proposes that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear weapon state but with the participation or support of a nuclear weapon state should be regarded as a joint attack on the Russian Federation the conditions for Russia's transition to the use of nuclear weapons are also clearly find we will consider such a possibility as soon as we receive reliable information about a massive launch of Aerospace attack means and their Crossing of our state border meaning strategic or tactical aircraft cruise missiles drones Hypersonic missiles and other aircraft we're now joined by Ambassador caval Cil former foreign secretary and Chancellor at javahar Neu University Robert sufa senior fellow of forward defense practice at Atlantic Council snow Croft Center for strategy and security and Major General Dru Kor director at the India foundation and director Emeritus at Clause thank you very much for joining us on the show gentlemen uh Robert sufa if I can begin with you uh what do you think about the timing of this change in the nuclear Doctrine by President Putin uh for uh for having me on I I think what Putin is after here is he's trying to discourage Ukraine's Western allies from uh uh supporting strikes against Russia particularly with the longrange systems that you mentioned uh I'm not sure this is a great change from uh Russia's nuclear doctrine of 2020 the bottom line is is that Russia would use nuclear weapons only if the existence of the state was at risk and it's hard to imagine that Ukrainian strikes even with long-range conventional systems would pose such a threat so I think it's more about responding to uh um the the the deliberation here in the United States as to whether or not to allow Ukraine to use these longer Range Systems but I don't see it as a a a change or a lowering of the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons all right Ambassador Cil you've got President Putin who has said that even uh a state like Ukraine if it gets support from a nuclear power and uses uh missiles against Russia and there is a critical threat to Russia then Russia can use nuclear weapons in defense so they've changed and added a number of areas or military threats when nuclear weapons can be used do you see this as a significant departure a significant signal to the West I think so because his earlier warnings about uh Russia being compelled to use uh nuclear weapons uh if there was an existential threat to Russia uh have not been taken seriously and this not the first time that he spoken about the inherent nuclear dangers in this conflict several times he's mentioned this with a view to discouraging uh the west from uh upping the ante and escalating uh the war against Russia to a point where Russia genuinely begins to feel uh seriously threatened um now these uh warnings have not been taken seriously I've seen Western commentators uh serious ones saying that Putin is bluffing and we should not fall in for this Bluff actually serious people have been saying this uh that he's he's just discouraging us the west from using the nuclear weapons and we should go ahead and do it the British have been very vocal uh about this at very senior level the former defense secretaries and everything else lvov in many statements has said that the West doesn't seem to be taking uh our concerns uh about attacks on Russia leading to the kind of escalation that will require the use of some kind of nuclear weapons seriously and that they laugh it away so I think in this background uh I think Putin has uh felt that it was time to send a more significant signal to the west and this is doing because there's a lot of pressure uh that is being built being built up so far the Americans have resisted it uh that zilinsky should be allowed to use long range missiles to hit deep into Russian territory now of course the range of these missiles is 300 kilometers so it will not be deep deep into Russian territory but the argument on the western side is that they will attack the bases the ammunition dumps the airports uh their bases and everything else and therefore reduce pressure on uh Ukraine uh of aial attacks by uh Russia uh so okay but what Putin has said and that's important that if they have information that there is a massive attack so he's not saying that if there is a attack here or there or a few missiles there or there would NE necessitate him to use nuclear weapons but if there is a massive attack uh so he's uh keeping margin for maneuver uh for himself now right you know British have been pushing very hard for the use of these the Americans have been little more reticent they see the consequences of this uh I understand I don't have any hard information on this I understand that the that Russia has used its own channels to convey a very strong message to the United States of the risk that would be involved uh if uh the United States went ahead and gave this green light to zilinski now right let me get a comment to that sir let me get a quick comment from Robert sufa and Le General K on that uh Robert sufa uh do you think this this crosses a sort of a red line uh for the United States are they going to take note of this will there be any kind of change in stance uh Vis Ukraine because the US in a way is indirectly involved in a war in the Middle East uh would they risk being drawn into a direct War uh in Europe as well well you're you're right the United States will will um will look very carefully at this and will not want to be drawn into a major war but let me just say that the United States understands Russia's nuclear Doctrine we have been um watching it for some time now uh it is a doctrine that does include the limited use of low yield nuclear weapons uh they have the capabilities they have Land Air and c-based uh nuclear forces that can be used on the battlefield so this is not new right and so we take this into account when we formulate our own Doctrine and what we do is is to provide NATO and the American president a range of nuclear options that can be used in response to a potential Russian use so Putin has to understand as well that should he escalate to the use of nuclear weapons and of course there's only one person that can decide whether and how to respond and that is the president of the United States but he has a range of capabilities and his intent will be I think to try to um uh shall we say uh demonstrate resolve and show that uh whatever LED Putin to think that he could use nuclear weapons and secure an advantage that that was false and that uh it was time now to stop further escalation or risk uh a broader nuclear configration which would not be in Putin's interest right General K how do you think uh this is going to be seen on the battlefield uh this is clearly sending a message out to the United States to Western Powers Russia uh would want to say that they're sending a message out to their enemy but what how would you explain these tactics right now as to what this means on the battlefield oh thank you very frankly in my opinion I think it is very clear messaging um I don't think that President Putin at this point of time is very keen to escalate the situation but I at the same time I I think uh it will be a red line as far as President Putin is concerned if a large number of longrange missiles are actually provided to Ukraine and they start using them in depth Targets in Russia that would be a red line and he has to answer to his people so the question is um you know the one of the panelist has very clearly said that we know that we know Russia's Doctrine and it um it here it appears to be a bluff that may be so but what happens if it isn't a bluff what happens if he's actually driven to the wall and he uses it then obviously there will be a retaliation and how do how do we um how do we control the situation after that I think it may totally spir out of control so I think it would be wise on the part of the West not to in not to um go go along that road they've got to stop uh stop before that and I think that there is great sense in stopping Ukraine from using any of the longrange weapons uh which the West can't Supply so from the west side I mean I personally feel they should not supply those weapons otherwise the risk of escalation is too great and while Russia will suffer that is that is that is for granted uh the US and the West will suffer equally and if it if if it goes beyond the threshold level then the whole world will suffer it is not going to stop there so uh I think we should pull back the nuclear trigger from both sides and uh it behoves the United States at this point of of time not to fallen into president zelinsky's tactics of trying to get more people into the war to draw them into the War uh that is one number two I have a feeling you know it's also related to the US elections because uh there is a feeling that if president Trump comes in there will be a marked change so uh let's see as to how that plays out in my view for the next month or so I don't see any any major changes coming out either in terms of the Russian threat or in terms of actual supply of these weapons by United States rightor SI what do you think can possibly happen do you think considering that we're just few weeks away from the US election result on the 5th of November do you think President Biden uh may just like to wait this out for a few months make sure that these long range missiles are not used by Ukraine see how things go and then probably take a call uh before I answer that there's one important uh point that Putin has been making which needs to be mentioned which is this that Ukraine itself does not have the capacity the technical know how to use these long range weapons this will require the presence of Western military personnel on the ground uh and that the storm shadows and others for their targeting in anything everything else with the satellite signaling and everything else intelligence that has to be provided by the West that's why he's saying that if Ukraine uses this he's presupposing that they will use this this with the active participation of Western instructors and Western technological inputs which means that they are involved in this that is one uh the other is that U uh Russia is not going to uh you know use nuclear weapons carelessly not at all I don't think Russia has any intention to do that he is just sending a very serious warning and in so far as United States is concerned so far they have not given the green light either to zinski or to Europe that is uh UK to go ahead and uh and allow the use of these missiles by Ukraine now uh right we have as you know bu Biden has just announced that 8 billion of assistance will now be given to Ukraine because otherwise it lapse plus another 1.2 billion or something uh additional military aid to Ukraine so they are staying below the threshold of of allowing or giving a green light to zinsky to use the longrange missile for which he's he's been pushing very hard because he wants to involve NATO now you seey is is getting C feet and schz has said very clearly I that he will not accept the use of these weapons against Russia all all right we're going to take a short break gentlemen we'll request you to stay with us we'll step into a break but when we return we will be discussing with all our three guests Russia's plan to reportedly set up a secret Ward drone project in China don't go anywhere we will be discussing the consequences of that on global ey welcome back you are watching Global ey Russia has set up a secret weapons program in China which will be used to build long range attack drones these drones will be reportedly used in its war with Ukraine as per a report by Reuters the program has has been set up by uh a a subsidiary of a Russian state-owned Arms Company the company has made and flight tested a new drone model in China China's foreign Ministry told Reuters that it was not aware of any such project while the US government has expressed deep concerns the US National Security Council said it has not not seen anything yet to suggest China was aware of these transactions or that there was a government involvement in facilitating the production of these lethals weapons they continue we continue to have our conversation with ambasador Cav Cil Robert sufa and mayor General Dru Koch as well uh Robert sufa if I were to begin with you uh how seriously do you say take these reports about Russia having a secret drone project in China uh the US has been worried all along that the components that are being used in Russian weapon systems right now a large extent at least 70% of them are coming from China so would you dismiss these reports outright would not dismiss the reports uh I haven't studied the reports so I don't know their validity but this is uh just further evidence of the uh uh collusion the collaboration between Russia and China you know that uh for the first time ever uh in our um our annual uh or our nuclear posture review and our national security strategy we've made the point here in the United States that we need to deter now two major nuclear Powers both Russia and China and this is just a a another example of how it's um important that we now take into account the the growing Chinese threat and the possibility the possibility that we could be engaged in a conflict against both countries either simultaneously or near sequentially right uh General K how do you think this is going to change China's role or the world's perception of China's role in this war could this be a buildup towards sanctioning China or maybe calling out China for its support to Russia very frankly China China has completely denied this story and um as far as the US is concerned the state the state department has also not confirmed it so um there is a doubt as to what exactly has happened but one statement which comes out that you know they say that the Chinese government is not aware of it now if there's some facility in China there is no way in which the Chinese government will not be aware of what Isen happening so to that extent that statement itself appears to be uh which has been issued quite obsurd but there is a point you see China has been supplying um components and subcomponents to Russia as far as their war effort is concerned and all these are dual use items they are actually supplying the engines for the the gapra A1 drone which is again a Kami Kazi drone and it's a long range Kami Kazi drone now this is the up scaled version of that particular drone so I see know firstly I don't understand why should Russia even think of manufacturing it in China where you can manufacture it in Russia it doesn't make sense and why should even China go down that road unless they wish to have a joint production or something so um to me there is there are there are too many um question marks as far as this is concerned but should it actually work out should it actually be proved to be true then I'm afraid China will open itself to sanctions those sanctions will be very s and considering their current economic situation they will be deeply impacted whether China has taken that risk go down that road or whether this is just a make believe story as of now time will tell but at the moment uh it is all um uh there is no confirmation yet as to what exactly is happening on the ground parit right uh ambass how how worried would you be uh about a situation like this on one hand Russia revising its nuclear Doctrine to send out of message to the West secondly reports emerging that Russia and China are colluding to make drones which are being used to attack Ukraine so what are your thoughts in terms of the larger dangers involved well firstly even if they're manufacturing together these drones this is not in the same category as nuclear weapons and doesn't pose that kind of a threat maybe their drones will become more efficient and will be able to reach deeper into Ukrainian territory uh where they'll be able to penetrate the Ukrainian defenses because they have become pretty uh powerful with the aid of the West is an open question secondly these reports to my mind first of all I I have no direct knowledge I can only speculate I would say that this is the kind of disinformation uh that is coming out from Western news agencies uh prompted by certain interests who want to create the impression that China and Russia are collabor ating and speculatively preempt the possibility of China actually getting involved in this kind of collaboration with Russia thirdly uh you know the word used word collusion and this and that and that but you know from the outside uh I don't see why if the whole of Europe NATO United States uh can supply arms to Ukraine to fight Russia uh to impose this strategic defeat in Russia and there is so much uh so much uh moral breast beating if China supports Russia why why can't China support Russia now by the same logic and finally sanctions you know it's easy to sanction Russia because Russia has been sanctioned since the 1970s or the Soviet Union has been sanctioned and there's not much uh trade of course with Europe there was considerable oil trade and this and that otherwise with United States and Russia there hasn't been much trade but look at the volume of trade between United States and China it is the biggest trade partner about 7 78 750 million billion dollars of trade both ra and then China is now controlling certain very critical Technologies and they're holding them back and this is causing concern in the west so if imposing sanctions on China will not be that costree step as as in the case of of Russia and the West would have to think more than once before they do it and Europe would be terribly affected if if China hits back so I I I I would again say that this is actually disinformation and even if it is not disinformation I can't see why there should be so much objection to China to also support Russia because China is the next Target of the United States openly they're saying that China is their principal enemy right thank you very much uh gentlemen for joining us on the program clearly we are in times of war and you see different kinds of Warfare on both in
