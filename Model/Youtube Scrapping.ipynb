searched to Fresh record highs in early trade however The Benchmark slipped into the red at the end of the day owing to profit booking but this wasn't enough to break a 3-we winning streak well

said everything and you remember when you said you know you know what's good you were right everything okay so if they if they you know this is they were this is incredible stuff for that place okay so it's everything we on to a CNBC TV8 exclusive Cisco's Global CEO Chuck Robbins has said that he's more excited about India's opportunities than ever before as the company inaugurates his first manufacturing facility in the country in Chennai speaking exclusively to Sharin ban he added that India was poised to become Cisco's key market for domestic growth as well as for exports Robins also added that Cisco was eyeing m& opportunities in the Nations expanding Ai and security startup space spoke about uh the manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu when you announced the decision to go ahead with that and today you inaugurated the facility uh just a few hours ago uh you know take us through what the journey from start to operationalizing has meant for you I have to say the most rewarding part of walking through the factory today and touring it we're seeing that the humans who are working in it where we've created these jobs it it really is fascin it's phenomenal uh looking seeing the products that we're building here and uh and thinking about the future and everything that we can do here it's just very exciting but the teams have done a good job getting us to this point we're excited about it we're we're obviously going to use this both domestically and for an export Hub so we think there's a bright future and a lot of Runway here is 2025 going to be a big year for m&a as well we're very happy with the Splunk acquisition you know if you think about it in a nutshell to to to be a great networking company you have to be a great security company to be a great security company you're going to have to be a great AI company and to be a great AI company you're going to have to be a great data company and we are the only company in the world that has all four of those and so we think that we're well positioned uh and we think that if we need other assets to actually continue to build on those capabilities then we'll we'll make those decisions as necessary well Chuck uh you know potential for India from an m&a point of view you talked about data you talked about security and we've got a bunch of startups operating in that space is uh is is there anything exciting on that front from an India perspective the exciting thing on the startup front in India is that it's expanding rapidly and uh there is a lot of focus on the very areas that are important to us if my memory serves me correctly I think we've made five Acquisitions here and we have we launched a billion dollar AI fund to actually invest in AI startups and I would suspect that there' be lots of opportunities here in India to to not only invest but potentially acquire uh when it makes sense now BB fintech which runs the insurance aggregator platform policy Bazar says it wants to fix the healthcare experience for Indians especially the class but Vice chairperson and whole-time director alok pansel tells CNBC tv18 sharen ban that it would be much better if interests were aligned between insurers and hospitals to give customers an amazing claims experience here's bunel speaking exclusively to CNBC TV8 Shireen ban about where things stand on that front and what else could be in store are you getting into the hospital business uh so see we we very very firmly believe that's a very important need for middle class India today uh the sort of overtreatment which happen in the hospitals the frauds which can come into this any person walking into a hospital is a revenue for the hospital but it's a cost for the insurance company so unless that part is controlled the consumer trust and we talking about middle class India yeah the consumer trust for that segment will not come and unless that consumer trust is not there they will not come to buy and even if they come to buy they will not buy they will just look at the options and go away but but getting into the asset management no it's not Asset Management it's the experience management asset can be owned by anyone it doesn't really matter but the experience has to be controlled by someone who understands the customer needs and the customer pain points has has the uh investor reaction startled you surprised you rattled you are you are you reconsidering the plan no no no no not at all see sh if you think about it we sort of started talking about it about four five months ago yeah the share price actually moved from 1300 to 1900 in that time frame so technically you can even say that okay investor loved it at that time frame now it's come down by something it's okay you know you can only do two things you can execute you can communicate what is happening in outside world is there not in your control speaking at the same event PTM CEO vij shakar Sharma has said that he regrets not choosing the correct Banker for the company's IPO remember PTM stock had tumbled 27% on its listing day on the 18th of November that's 2021 making it one of India's worst large IPOs currently the stock is down 69% from from its offer price Sharma also added that PTM did not attract VC investments in the initial 7 years since the Inception of the company and that he has been a bootstrapped entrepreneur I have a

the app applicants should be under 8 lakh rupees annually this family income includes income from the candidates parents as well as spouse now another likely eligibility Norm is that candidates shouldn't be pursuing any formal degree or a formal job though online courses or vocational training will still qualify them for the internship program on the industry side government is likely to allow companies to engage interns across their supply chain and as well as their group companies but the certification of the internship will have to come from the main company this sources say is to keep the corporates invested in the progress of the of the interns and with this the MCA is also asking corporates that all the roles given to these interns should be skill-based not menial at all sources say that training costs are likely to be covered by CSR funds now there is no upper limit or cap as of uh as on how much the corporates would spend on training the in turn so the money can be utilized from the CSR fund apart from this a monthly sent of 500 rupees will be given to the interns from the CSR fund and 4500 as we know from the government totaling to a 5,000 rupees per intern per month the government will also provide as we know one time additional time payment of 6,000 Rupees to the interns now the internship portal that will also go live in a week is likely to match candidate skills with the corporates corporate needs automatically generating CVS and sharing them with the corporate HR teams the portal will also offer a multilingual call center support to help applicants navigate the process this program as announced in the 2024 budget aims to boost youth employment by addressing India's skill Gap back to you right chani thanks a lot for that now here's

forget about listing n de right you know well the union representing over 33,000 Boeing factory workers in USA's Pacific Northwest said it will resume negotiations with the company overpay this comes as the union workers strike in demand of a 40% pay hike over 3 years near as its third week keska Sharma is joining us now with more uh keska what is the playmaker planning to do to avoid prolonging the operation stoppage boing and the union covering striking workers in USA Seattle and Portland regions will resume stall contract talks today as the plane maker seeks to avoid a prolonged stoppage at the strike nears its third week it's been two weeks since Boeing factory workers in that region have been striking for the first time in 16 years the union of 33,000 workers is originally demanding a 40% pay hike over 3 years Boeing has so far made two offers to the Striking workers they rejected the initial offer of a 25% pay increase and the first round of mediat talks broke down last week without a deal being reached the plane maker then made what it called its best and final offer of a 30% raise in pay over 4 years direct to the workers which infuriated union leaders who slamed the attempt to bypass them as disrespectful boing however said that its last offer would take the average annual pay for Machinist from about $75,600 now to $11.11 lakh at the end of the 4-year contract it would also keep annual bonuses based on productivity when in the rejected offer uh Boeing sought to replace those payouts with new contributions to retirement accounts but following the Union's opposition to the offer going back down Tuesday and gave the union more time to consider the new proposal however many workers said that the company's latest offer wasn't good enough considering the increased living cost since the last negotiation 16 years ago noting that the only way to resolve the strike is through negotiations a regional district of the International Association of machinist and Aerospace workers said that the two sides would meet again today to discuss the matter alongside Federal mediators now the impact of the strike is that it has led to a shutdown of production of Boeing 737s 767s and 777s it has also led the company to make cost cutting moves including rolling temporary fur lows for thousands of non-union managers and employees right keska thanks a lot for

commission needs to be more active end of Court the two judge bench also questioned the panel for not meeting and reviewing such a serious issue more regularly further the court has asked the panel to file an affidavit before the hearing the next hearing on the 3rd of October and coming up on India business are old school convenience stores popularly known as kirana stores are feeling the heat of quick Commerce boom a special report in just a bate and you can also catch all CNBC TV1 18's news and updates on Facebook X threads Instagram and geoc Cinema now Israel has rejected Global calls for a 21-day ceasefire with hollah as it continued attacks in the southern part of Lebanon prime minister Nathan yahu has vowed that the Israeli military would continue to bombard hispa Targets in indefinitely according to Lebanese officials Israeli air strikes have killed nearly 700 people in the region so far Israeli Defense Forces have claimed to hit about 220 hollah related targets officials also said that strikes on Suburban areas of Beirut have killed the head of the militant group's drone unit meanwhile Israel has claimed that HPA launched Rockets towards hia and its surrounding regions in Northern Israel Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu also said that the country will continue to Target HPA with full force my policy our policy is clear We are continuing to hit Hezbollah with full force and we will not stop until we achieve all our goals first and foremost returning the residents of the north safely to their homes Palestinian president mmud Abbas has criticized Joe Biden Le Administration for providing diplomatic support to Israel despite the mounting death toll in Gaza in his address at the UN General Assembly Mahmud urged the International Community to stop supplying weapons to Israel and also laid out a 12-point road map for post-ww war management more than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the War Began in October of 2023 well back home quick Commerce has changed the way people shop the convenience it offers is increasingly making old school convenience stores or kirana stores redundant in the second part of CNBC TV8 series it by it CNBC TV8 Shilpa Rani Peta reports that many of India's 30 million kirana stores are struggling to stay [Music] alive India's consumers are an impatient lot and India's ubiquitous neighborhood kirana stores are losing business first quick Commerce platforms took away the forgetful absent-minded customer who popped into stores for some last minute purchases and now increasingly even the regulars who drop by once a week or once a month for their planned purchases are choosing to let their fingers do the walking reports suggest the rapid rise of quick Commerce platforms has taken away 25 to 30% of the business kirana stores could boast and Industry bodies claim nearly 25% of India's 30 million kirana stores are on the verge of shutting shop the when these competitors are entered so now what has happened is customer's mindset and customer itself has the Habit the practice of them ordering grocery has changed completely so what has happened even if they want to order say 200 rupee uh 200 rupee item or 300 rupe item they want quick delivery and this is the Habit which is which is what uh where we are facing a big competition over the last two years uh these kirana stores have seen a significant negative impact because ofcommerce forms where there's impulse buying for certain kind of products those are things you know which are bought from the kirana stores or probably you know somebody would go and pick them up but I think because of the convenience that quick Commerce offers uh this is you know kind of hampered growth for kirana stores in the Metro cities and if at all quick Commerce scales up beyond the Metro cities they go to tier two and tier three markets and if at all they able to attain success there as well you will see a bigger negative impact for kirana stores as a whole it's not just the ease of ordering and the speed of delivery that has worked in Ecommerce favor it's the discounts on offer which kirana stores are unable to match for kirana stores costs are also mounting the margins offered by fmcg manufacturers has dropped to 10 to 12% lower than the 18 to 20% they got before the covid-19 pandemic establishment costs and stockholding costs are also Rising something QC Commerce platforms are able to offset with scale the profit margin of a kirana store is not more than 5 to 10% of a % to the max one primary concern and issue what we are thinking is that increasing control of with Commerce platform over their products on distribution in a primary case in many cases a single platform assume full control over sales and distribution of a product the all India consumer products distribution Association has filed a complaint with the Commerce Ministry raising concerns over the threat of quick Commerce and alleging a host of missteps including violation of FDI Norms some kirana stores meanwhile have chosen to innovate and try to fight for survival these range from trying to connect with consumers via WhatsApp to spruing up their stores and widening products on offer to integrating billing and backend systems using technology we have also tried to slowly gradually change our modules store was always an offline store uh since now we have also started little bit of online if you have seen the traditional store what in olden times it used to be more brighter the displays have changed what I see that a personal people who requires a personal service will definitely come to the stores but these Innovations come with costs attached and it's not something every store is able to afford so while Kiran stores try to put their head above the water they're hoping that familiarity trust and the need for touch and feel will keep bringing the regular customers to their stores and that will help keep the lights on

       " \"hello and welcome to Global ey I'm parit lutra in a warning to the Western Nations Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia would use its nuclear Arsenal if it was struck with conventional missiles by Ukraine he added that Moscow would consider it to be a joint attack if any of the western nuclear poers supported the missile attacks by Ukraine a non-nuclear nation Putin's comments and threats come on the back of reports that ke was seeking the approval of the United States and UK to use long range Western missiles against Russia the updated version of the document proposes that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear weapon state but with the participation or support of a nuclear weapon state should be regarded as a joint attack on the Russian Federation the conditions for Russia's transition to the use of nuclear weapons are also clearly find we will consider such a possibility as soon as we receive reliable information about a massive launch of Aerospace attack means and their Crossing of our state border meaning strategic or tactical aircraft cruise missiles drones Hypersonic missiles and other aircraft we're now joined by Ambassador caval Cil former foreign secretary and Chancellor at javahar Neu University Robert sufa senior fellow of forward defense practice at Atlantic Council snow Croft Center for strategy and security and Major General Dru Kor director at the India foundation and director Emeritus at Clause thank you very much for joining us on the show gentlemen uh Robert sufa if I can begin with you uh what do you think about the timing of this change in the nuclear Doctrine by President Putin uh for uh for having me on I I think what Putin is after here is he's trying to discourage Ukraine's Western allies from uh uh supporting strikes against Russia particularly with the longrange systems that you mentioned uh I'm not sure this is a great change from uh Russia's nuclear doctrine of 2020 the bottom line is is that Russia would use nuclear weapons only if the existence of the state was at risk and it's hard to imagine that Ukrainian strikes even with long-range conventional systems would pose such a threat so I think it's more about responding to uh um the the the deliberation here in the United States as to whether or not to allow Ukraine to use these longer Range Systems but I don't see it as a a a change or a lowering of the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons all right Ambassador Cil you've got President Putin who has said that even uh a state like Ukraine if it gets support from a nuclear power and uses uh missiles against Russia and there is a critical threat to Russia then Russia can use nuclear weapons in defense so they've changed and added a number of areas or military threats when nuclear weapons can be used do you see this as a significant departure a significant signal to the West I think so because his earlier warnings about uh Russia being compelled to use uh nuclear weapons uh if there was an existential threat to Russia uh have not been taken seriously and this not the first time that he spoken about the inherent nuclear dangers in this conflict several times he's mentioned this with a view to discouraging uh the west from uh upping the ante and escalating uh the war against Russia to a point where Russia genuinely begins to feel uh seriously threatened um now these uh warnings have not been taken seriously I've seen Western commentators uh serious ones saying that Putin is bluffing and we should not fall in for this Bluff actually serious people have been saying this uh that he's he's just discouraging us the west from using the nuclear weapons and we should go ahead and do it the British have been very vocal uh about this at very senior level the former defense secretaries and everything else lvov in many statements has said that the West doesn't seem to be taking uh our concerns uh about attacks on Russia leading to the kind of escalation that will require the use of some kind of nuclear weapons seriously and that they laugh it away so I think in this background uh I think Putin has uh felt that it was time to send a more significant signal to the west and this is doing because there's a lot of pressure uh that is being built being built up so far the Americans have resisted it uh that zilinsky should be allowed to use long range missiles to hit deep into Russian territory now of course the range of these missiles is 300 kilometers so it will not be deep deep into Russian territory but the argument on the western side is that they will attack the bases the ammunition dumps the airports uh their bases and everything else and therefore reduce pressure on uh Ukraine uh of aial attacks by uh Russia uh so okay but what Putin has said and that's important that if they have information that there is a massive attack so he's not saying that if there is a attack here or there or a few missiles there or there would NE necessitate him to use nuclear weapons but if there is a massive attack uh so he's uh keeping margin for maneuver uh for himself now right you know British have been pushing very hard for the use of these the Americans have been little more reticent they see the consequences of this uh I understand I don't have any hard information on this I understand that the that Russia has used its own channels to convey a very strong message to the United States of the risk that would be involved uh if uh the United States went ahead and gave this green light to zilinski now right let me get a comment to that sir let me get a quick comment from Robert sufa and Le General K on that uh Robert sufa uh do you think this this crosses a sort of a red line uh for the United States are they going to take note of this will there be any kind of change in stance uh Vis Ukraine because the US in a way is indirectly involved in a war in the Middle East uh would they risk being drawn into a direct War uh in Europe as well well you're you're right the United States will will um will look very carefully at this and will not want to be drawn into a major war but let me just say that the United States understands Russia's nuclear Doctrine we have been um watching it for some time now uh it is a doctrine that does include the limited use of low yield nuclear weapons uh they have the capabilities they have Land Air and c-based uh nuclear forces that can be used on the battlefield so this is not new right and so we take this into account when we formulate our own Doctrine and what we do is is to provide NATO and the American president a range of nuclear options that can be used in response to a potential Russian use so Putin has to understand as well that should he escalate to the use of nuclear weapons and of course there's only one person that can decide whether and how to respond and that is the president of the United States but he has a range of capabilities and his intent will be I think to try to um uh shall we say uh demonstrate resolve and show that uh whatever LED Putin to think that he could use nuclear weapons and secure an advantage that that was false and that uh it was time now to stop further escalation or risk uh a broader nuclear configration which would not be in Putin's interest right General K how do you think uh this is going to be seen on the battlefield uh this is clearly sending a message out to the United States to Western Powers Russia uh would want to say that they're sending a message out to their enemy but what how would you explain these tactics right now as to what this means on the battlefield oh thank you very frankly in my opinion I think it is very clear messaging um I don't think that President Putin at this point of time is very keen to escalate the situation but I at the same time I I think uh it will be a red line as far as President Putin is concerned if a large number of longrange missiles are actually provided to Ukraine and they start using them in depth Targets in Russia that would be a red line and he has to answer to his people so the question is um you know the one of the panelist has very clearly said that we know that we know Russia's Doctrine and it um it here it appears to be a bluff that may be so but what happens if it isn't a bluff what happens if he's actually driven to the wall and he uses it then obviously there will be a retaliation and how do how do we um how do we control the situation after that I think it may totally spir out of control so I think it would be wise on the part of the West not to in not to um go go along that road they've got to stop uh stop before that and I think that there is great sense in stopping Ukraine from using any of the longrange weapons uh which the West can't Supply so from the west side I mean I personally feel they should not supply those weapons otherwise the risk of escalation is too great and while Russia will suffer that is that is that is for granted uh the US and the West will suffer equally and if it if if it goes beyond the threshold level then the whole world will suffer it is not going to stop there so uh I think we should pull back the nuclear trigger from both sides and uh it behoves the United States at this point of of time not to fallen into president zelinsky's tactics of trying to get more people into the war to draw them into the War uh that is one number two I have a feeling you know it's also related to the US elections because uh there is a feeling that if president Trump comes in there will be a marked change so uh let's see as to how that plays out in my view for the next month or so I don't see any any major changes coming out either in terms of the Russian threat or in terms of actual supply of these weapons by United States rightor SI what do you think can possibly happen do you think considering that we're just few weeks away from the US election result on the 5th of November do you think President Biden uh may just like to wait this out for a few months make sure that these long range missiles are not used by Ukraine see how things go and then probably take a call uh before I answer that there's one important uh point that Putin has been making which needs to be mentioned which is this that Ukraine itself does not have the capacity the technical know how to use these long range weapons this will require the presence of Western military personnel on the ground uh and that the storm shadows and others for their targeting in anything everything else with the satellite signaling and everything else intelligence that has to be provided by the West that's why he's saying that if Ukraine uses this he's presupposing that they will use this this with the active participation of Western instructors and Western technological inputs which means that they are involved in this that is one uh the other is that U uh Russia is not going to uh you know use nuclear weapons carelessly not at all I don't think Russia has any intention to do that he is just sending a very serious warning and in so far as United States is concerned so far they have not given the green light either to zinski or to Europe that is uh UK to go ahead and uh and allow the use of these missiles by Ukraine now uh right we have as you know bu Biden has just announced that 8 billion of assistance will now be given to Ukraine because otherwise it lapse plus another 1.2 billion or something uh additional military aid to Ukraine so they are staying below the threshold of of allowing or giving a green light to zinsky to use the longrange missile for which he's he's been pushing very hard because he wants to involve NATO now you seey is is getting C feet and schz has said very clearly I that he will not accept the use of these weapons against Russia all all right we're going to take a short break gentlemen we'll request you to stay with us we'll step into a break but when we return we will be discussing with all our three guests Russia's plan to reportedly set up a secret Ward drone project in China don't go anywhere we will be discussing the consequences of that on global ey welcome back you are watching Global ey Russia has set up a secret weapons program in China which will be used to build long range attack drones these drones will be reportedly used in its war with Ukraine as per a report by Reuters the program has has been set up by uh a a subsidiary of a Russian state-owned Arms Company the company has made and flight tested a new drone model in China China's foreign Ministry told Reuters that it was not aware of any such project while the US government has expressed deep concerns the US National Security Council said it has not not seen anything yet to suggest China was aware of these transactions or that there was a government involvement in facilitating the production of these lethals weapons they continue we continue to have our conversation with ambasador Cav Cil Robert sufa and mayor General Dru Koch as well uh Robert sufa if I were to begin with you uh how seriously do you say take these reports about Russia having a secret drone project in China uh the US has been worried all along that the components that are being used in Russian weapon systems right now a large extent at least 70% of them are coming from China so would you dismiss these reports outright would not dismiss the reports uh I haven't studied the reports so I don't know their validity but this is uh just further evidence of the uh uh collusion the collaboration between Russia and China you know that uh for the first time ever uh in our um our annual uh or our nuclear posture review and our national security strategy we've made the point here in the United States that we need to deter now two major nuclear Powers both Russia and China and this is just a a another example of how it's um important that we now take into account the the growing Chinese threat and the possibility the possibility that we could be engaged in a conflict against both countries either simultaneously or near sequentially right uh General K how do you think this is going to change China's role or the world's perception of China's role in this war could this be a buildup towards sanctioning China or maybe calling out China for its support to Russia very frankly China China has completely denied this story and um as far as the US is concerned the state the state department has also not confirmed it so um there is a doubt as to what exactly has happened but one statement which comes out that you know they say that the Chinese government is not aware of it now if there's some facility in China there is no way in which the Chinese government will not be aware of what Isen happening so to that extent that statement itself appears to be uh which has been issued quite obsurd but there is a point you see China has been supplying um components and subcomponents to Russia as far as their war effort is concerned and all these are dual use items they are actually supplying the engines for the the gapra A1 drone which is again a Kami Kazi drone and it's a long range Kami Kazi drone now this is the up scaled version of that particular drone so I see know firstly I don't understand why should Russia even think of manufacturing it in China where you can manufacture it in Russia it doesn't make sense and why should even China go down that road unless they wish to have a joint production or something so um to me there is there are there are too many um question marks as far as this is concerned but should it actually work out should it actually be proved to be true then I'm afraid China will open itself to sanctions those sanctions will be very s and considering their current economic situation they will be deeply impacted whether China has taken that risk go down that road or whether this is just a make believe story as of now time will tell but at the moment uh it is all um uh there is no confirmation yet as to what exactly is happening on the ground parit right uh ambass how how worried would you be uh about a situation like this on one hand Russia revising its nuclear Doctrine to send out of message to the West secondly reports emerging that Russia and China are colluding to make drones which are being used to attack Ukraine so what are your thoughts in terms of the larger dangers involved well firstly even if they're manufacturing together these drones this is not in the same category as nuclear weapons and doesn't pose that kind of a threat maybe their drones will become more efficient and will be able to reach deeper into Ukrainian territory uh where they'll be able to penetrate the Ukrainian defenses because they have become pretty uh powerful with the aid of the West is an open question secondly these reports to my mind first of all I I have no direct knowledge I can only speculate I would say that this is the kind of disinformation uh that is coming out from Western news agencies uh prompted by certain interests who want to create the impression that China and Russia are collabor ating and speculatively preempt the possibility of China actually getting involved in this kind of collaboration with Russia thirdly uh you know the word used word collusion and this and that and that but you know from the outside uh I don't see why if the whole of Europe NATO United States uh can supply arms to Ukraine to fight Russia uh to impose this strategic defeat in Russia and there is so much uh so much uh moral breast beating if China supports Russia why why can't China support Russia now by the same logic and finally sanctions you know it's easy to sanction Russia because Russia has been sanctioned since the 1970s or the Soviet Union has been sanctioned and there's not much uh trade of course with Europe there was considerable oil trade and this and that otherwise with United States and Russia there hasn't been much trade but look at the volume of trade between United States and China it is the biggest trade partner about 7 78 750 million billion dollars of trade both ra and then China is now controlling certain very critical Technologies and they're holding them back and this is causing concern in the west so if imposing sanctions on China will not be that costree step as as in the case of of Russia and the West would have to think more than once before they do it and Europe would be terribly affected if if China hits back so I I I I would again say that this is actually disinformation and even if it is not disinformation I can't see why there should be so much objection to China to also support Russia because China is the next Target of the United States openly they're saying that China is their principal enemy right thank you very much uh gentlemen for joining us on the program clearly we are in times of war and you see different kinds of Warfare on both in

solar as well as wind assets uh now Vari renewable Tech which is the listed company uh has been focused on solar EPC which is engineering procurement and construction uh they have emerged as Market leaders in that particular segment which is why now the focus has shifted to become an IP which is an independent power producing platform and hence the acquisition is being considered what we've also learned from our sources is that through this acquisition Vari wants to foray into IP uh if this uh transaction moves forward but they're not the only ones competing for NLS India stick there's also jsw energy we did trite to Vari uh but we haven't received a response yet from them now Israel has rejected Global calls for a 21-day ceasefire with HPA as it continued attacks on Southern Lebanon prime minister Nathan yahu has vowed that Israeli military would continue to bombard Hisar targets indefinitely according to Lebanese officials Israeli air strikes have killed nearly 700 people in the region so far Israeli Defense Forces have claimed to have hit 200 and 20 hasp out targets officials also said that strikes on Suburban areas of beut have killed head of the militant groups grown unit meanwhile Israel has claimed that HPA launched Rockets towards hia and its surroundings in Northern is Israel Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu also said that the country will continue to Target Hezbollah with full force my policy our policy is clear We are continuing to hit Hezbollah with full force and we will not stop until we achieve all our goals first and foremost returning the residents of the north safely to their homes meanwhile Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas has criticized the Joe Biden Le Administration for providing diplomatic support to Israel despite the mouthing uh death toll in Gaza in his address at the UN General Assembly Mahmud urged the International Community to stop supplying weapons to Israel and also laid out a 12-point road map for post-war management more than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the War Began in October 2023 well with that it's time now for a short break but coming up quick Commerce has changed the way people shop how will this impact Kiran stores a special report coming up welcome back now quick Commerce has changed the way people shop the convenience it offers is increasingly making old school convenience stores or kirana stores redundant in the second part of CNBC TV8 series think it buy it CNBC TV8 Shilpa Rani Peta reports that many of India's 30 million kirana stores are struggling to stay [Music] alive India's consumers are an impatient lot and India's ubiquitous neighborhood kirana stores are losing business first quick Commerce platforms took away the forgetful or absent-minded customer who popped into stores for some last minute purchases and now increasingly even the regulars who drop by once a week or once a month for their planned purchases are choosing to let their fingers do the walking reports suggest the rapid rise of quick Commerce platforms has taken away 25 to 30% of the business kirana stores could boost and Industry bodies claim nearly 25% of India's 30 million kirana stores are on the verge of shutting shop the when these competitors have entered so now what has happened is customers's mindset and customer itself has the Habit the practice of them ordering grocery has changed completely so what has happened even if they want to order say 200 rupee uh 200 rupee item or 300 rupe item they want quick delivery and this is the Habit which is which is what uh where we are facing a big competition over the last two years uh these kirana stores have seen a significant negative impact because ofcommerce platforms where there's impulse buying for certain kind of products those are things you know which are bought from the kirana stores or probably you know somebody would go and pick them up but I think because of the convenience that quick Commerce offers uh this is you know kind of hampered growth for kirana stores in the Metro cities and if at all quick Commerce scales up beyond the Metro cities they go to tier two and tier three markets and if at all they able to attain success there as well you will see a bigger negative impact for kirana stores as a whole it's not just the ease of ordering and the speed of delivery that has worked in qcom favor it's the discounts on offer which Kiran stores are unable to match for kirana stores costs are also mounting the margins offered by fmcg manufacturers has dropped to 10 to 12% lower than the 18 to 20% they got before the covid-19 pandemic establishment costs and stockholding costs are also Rising something Q Commerce platforms are able to offset with scale the profit margin of a kirana store is not more than 5 to 10% or 15% to the max one primary concern and issue what we are thinking as that increasing control of quick Commerce platform over their products on distribution in a primary case in many cases a single platform assume full control over sales and distribution of a product the all India consumer products distribution Association has filed a complaint with a Commerce Ministry raising concerns over the threat of quick Commerce and alleging a host of missteps including violation of FDI Norms some kirana stores meanwhile have chosen to innovate and try to fight for survival these range from trying to connect with consumers via WhatsApp to sprucing up their stores and widening products on offer to integrating billing and backend systems using technology we have also tried to slowly gradually change our modules store was always an offline store uh since now we have also started little bit of online if you have SE the traditional store what in olden times it used to beore more brighter the displays have changed what I see that uh a personal people who requires a personal service will definitely come to the stores but these Innovations come with costs attached and it's not something every store is able to afford so while Kiran stores try to put their head above the water they're hoping that familiarity trust and the need for touch and feel will keep bringing the regular customers to their stores and that will help keep the lights on for now but they say that without government Intervention which could be in the form of protectionist policies or easier access to funding for Tech upgradation long-term survival is still not in the basket in Mumbai sharani and with that it's a wrap on this edition of

       " \"hello and welcome to News Center I'm parit lutra Hundai motor the maker of the popular creta SUV has got an approval for its 25,000 CR rupe IPO which is going to be India's biggest ever CNBC tv18 has learned that Hyundai is targeting a listing by Dali the total offer size is 14.2 CR Equity shares and hunai expects a valuation between 1.5 lakh CR rupees and 1.7 lakh CR Rupees hyai is India second largest car maker in terms of domestic sales their plant in Chennai has an annual production capacity of 8.2 lakh units and the acquisition of General Motors taliga plant will add another 2 lakh units Hyundai which has a strong portfolio of SUVs and a 14% market share faces competition from maruti which is the market leader and Tata Motors as well the company's IPO is coming at a time when the industry is witnessing low demand and the overall growth is expected to be just 3% in F525 joining us now to delve into the Journey of brand Hyundai in India and the challenges it may face post listing is bbrr subu a veteran of the Indian automobile industry and the former president of Hyundai India for nearly a decade also the author of the book santro the car that built a company Mr subu thank you very much for joining us uh this also must be a special moment for you when India is actually preparing for its uh IPO give us a sense of how the company is actually now poised for for the future it is the second largest car maker in terms of sales but there is stiff competition yeah well um when you call it second largest car maker I think it got to that second largest car maker within 6 months of startup so uh it's been the second largest car maker for a long long time 25 years plus actually um well yeah it is it is very very interesting to see the the company and you know to try and and and look back uh to how the uh the journey really started um tough days initial days we uh we battled the uh the the financial meltdown in Korea uh the parent just couldn't uh didn't have enough um you know funds to support us through you know as much as we would have liked to um a bunch of things that happened but um but it was very interesting and very uh uh very satisfying Journey for a lot of us who were there at the very beginning um the the the early pioneers of hund's days in India right uh what is the biggest challenge you feel that the company is going to face post listing sir you know for that to answer that perhaps you should start with trying to look at what were the what are the Foundation blocks for the uh uh uh for the entire um uh what should I say the growth of Hundai and if you try and put those I I would try and put those into five or perhaps six heads I put that under um for starters I think you should look at the the product technology etc etc you should look at product quality durability reliability you could look at um you could look at uh uh product uh uh support um support systems and so on you could look at production efficiencies but most important I think you should look at uh the organizational DNA of the of the company as it then was remember that uh at that time it was uh uh um you know a challenger uh a very youthful vibrant uh uh uh young company with u uh with should I should I say um you know with a lot of ambition um therefore very Fleet footed uh um very agile um I think you know typically what happens is that companies sometimes tend to grow uh when they grow uh they sometimes lose some of those attributes uh so one of the things that it had then was uh its ability to listen to Consumers and it's and a lot of humility um this kind of thing you know typically changes in companies as they grow toward middle-age so then instead of being young and Fleet footed you might just get a little sty a little uh what should I say um you know around the mid Rift you may put on a little too much weight terms of management I mean and and and so on and you know that is I think uh uh the big challenge that Hundai would face today because try and look at it like this you know when you go public um uh there is a far greater uh amount of scrutiny that the company will have to to face um now when you look at that scrutiny what would that be it would be in terms of it could be anything it could be a bunch of things could be related party transactions you know the kind of purchases that you make from sister companies or connected companies whatever whether it's in purchases or it could be in logistics could be in advertising could be in a bunch of things so related party transactions will be a lot of focus areas uh for particular for analysts and um you know proxy funds and for people like even independent directors on the other hand there'll be a bunch of governance issues that um you know hund might nowadays find quite uh uh might find challenging you know uh when I talked of the organizational DNA one thing that I think has happened unfortunately in Hundai is an organizational culture has not been built Bu from within so you've had a lot of transplants from other parts of Industry which have which hasn't necessarily um been so great because you have had uh issues of um ethical standards uh falling and people having to move out you I mean you can't really have a situation where you bring in someone uh from a competitor a guy has let's say Posh issues being or looked in for Posh issues and then you give him lead ship role that kind of a thing you know is is a little um should I say would be tough it'll come under a lot of scrutiny so that is one Rel related party transactions and ESG compliance will be a big problem for Hyundai so you feel that ESG compliance and related party transactions and and governance issues in general would be an area where the company would be questioned I would say not just ESG you know ESG ES is um I know it's it's it's helped consultants and uh and Auditors uh very you know become very very relevant but governance in in a more direct sense uh is what I'm talking about but moving on from the organizational DNA issues I think the other area that hund could face a major challenges when you looked at the early days hundi was the absolute leader in technology I mean when maruti was still talking in terms of you know was uh um you know loading the uh the benefits of a carburetor technology hund came in and said look the world is driving mpfi India deserves mpfi when you know people were still talking of Idi diesel engines in the in the country H said no uh we believe the world is going to be driving common rail so we bring in common rail you know so hund was the absolute technology leader then that leadership position it seems to have seeded now in more ways than one I mean look at hybrids for instance now what happens with hybrids is now if you have a Toyota Camry um today probably gets what 16 kilm 177 km liter uh uh on Delhi streets um now hundi creta which is their largest selling model um you know probably gives 8 maybe 9 km per liter I I don't know in real life real term conditions I'm not talking of air Ai and all that is advertised I'm talking real life what consumers based now in such a situation without a a hybrid technology capability um the creta might find itself uh um you know under a lot of pressure now that is the largest selling model now on a creta typically you know Hundai probably makes for an average uh ticket size ticket price of sticket price of 14 or laks we're probably making 3 lakhs or so per car when this kind of thing happens you would could find the the creta under tremendous pricing pressure you know you have for one on the one side consumers going Gaga or the fuel efficiency of hybrids on the other hand you have some State saying okay we're cutting down Road tax on on on uh um you know on hybrids now this will put pressure on their um on their Cash Cow and when that happens you know it could it could uh impact uh it could impact shareholders potential shareholders very very significantly I think I think this is one I would say probably the biggest concern yeah on the one hand Hundai has electrics and the electric vehicles of Hyundai are very very good the ionic 5 is probably amongst the best in its catter globally but in India I don't see electric cars uh really taking off in the same way today it it's got a you know it two wheelers three wheelers is a completely different economic case but in cars per se I I you know if you look at um if you look at cars uh in the electric space um it's a bunch of other things that really impact demand and today with a 5% GST yeah cars are still looking high price with let's say 20 % GST or 10% GST um something going happen because ultimately the government cannot keep you know keep on with uh uh uh uh the kind of product you know of subsiding to cars uh electric cars don't let's not forget that this government the government probably makes 2 and a half trillion rupees in terms of Po GS excise tax excise duties so you know you can't wish that so you you can't you won't let it die just like that so there a bunch of those is let me also also bring one more point I think Hundai still a decent yeah let me also bring in one more point do you feel that this IPO could have been done earlier I think in your book you've also touched upon the fact that the company had probably contemplated an IPO some years back as well well actually when uh when we when the company came in when the company started it was actually um you know uh had to raise funds and it actually looked at uh um you know selling out a significant stake to the UTI and uh uh UTI and AIG um but you know they they they uh they didn't really get down to agreeing to the price I if I recall right it was they wanted it at 1475 and H was not willing to go below 17 or something so there was a it was I mean I'm sure they must be really um you know cursing their luck on this no even after that um the the agreement with the government was I think uh to actually go for an IPO after 7 years but somehow the government kind of didn't insist on that so um ultimately H did not go in from there but today I think things are kind of different from for hundi H needs this IPO today from India um look at the kind of dividend that's been taking out for the last 3 years consistently uh so that's one side of it but when the kind of Investments That Hundai uh globally is making on EVS for instance it needs a significant amount of u significant amount of uh um what should I say dividend income coming out of India or actually you know actually actually sell out of India to take the scream uh for its other larger Global Ambitions that is that is I think why this uh uh IPO is happening now uh that's that's um that's the way I would read it you know so I'm running out of time so I'll put one more final question to you sir if I can and that would be what do you think uh Hyundai now needs to do for success in the future currently it's coming out with a creta electric SUV early next year for four new electric cars by 2030 if I were to ask you one thing that the company needs to do right or maybe two or three things what would those be sir if you could probably give us a sense briefly uh number one clean fire in the belly company with a young Outlook number one uh number two technology Focus uh uh technology focus and uh um you know I would say getting back to technology leadership and uh um another thing number three is communicating better I I mean you know what do Hundai ads say today do they even say anything to Consumers whether it's on whether it's on electronic media whether it's on social media so I mean what are you communicating what values what does the company stand for what are you talking about I think this is something so you know that's why I said you know middle-age compeny uh uh I think you know with uh with an expanding midrift I think is one of the biggest problems the H faces and I mean I I would say they would have to do something very fast because if someone Nimble I mean one of the other companies get a little more Nimble uh Nimble in the head first uh um I mean today look at it except for the dealers in the company nobody else knows the uh uh the has the same sense of uh um how the company was created 60 70 dealers who are still around nobody else knows so they the feeling the passion is not there you can't have 12 people doing the job of two people even if you expanded uh you know your range of production by I mean your volume of production from say 350 to 800,000 two people can't do the job I mean 12 people can't be asked to do the job of two people you that's something the company has to think about these are things that I think the company has to get a uh um you know get a handle on now all right that's an important point and note to end on sir thank thank you so much for joining us it's always a pleasure having you here on CNBC TV8 talking about your journey at Hyundai and how do you think the company is PO for the future and the mantras with success that the company should possibly keep in mind always a pleasure of speaking to you sir time for a short break here on CNBC TV8 but up next the corporate uh Ministry the ministry of corporate Affairs is expected to roll out guidelines for the center's internship program within next week a special discussion on the other side [Music]\",\n",
       " \"Global leader in security and networking Cisco inaugurated its first manufacturing facility in India in Chennai the site will produce Cisco's routing and switching products to meet domestic demand and also be exported from India and this marks the first phase of Cisco's multi-year investment plan with this Cisco aims to drive over $1.3 billion in revenue and also create 1,200 Jobs in the state of Tamil Nado joining me now to talk about the new facility Cisco's India and Global plans is Chuck Robbins the chair and CEO of Cisco Chuck it's always a pleasure many thanks for joining us here on the global dialogue it's great to have you back uh uh Chuck we spoke about uh the manufacturing facility in taminadu when you announced the decision to go ahead with that and today you inaugurated the facility uh just a few hours ago uh you know take us through what the journey from start to operationalizing has meant for you well first of all thanks for having me it's always great to talk to you and it's always great to be here in India sorry I couldn't see you in person but uh we have uh we're very excited about this announcement today or the inauguration today uh you know back in May of 2023 I met with the Prime Minister and we committed to actually this facility and I have to say the most rewarding part of walking through the factory today and touring it we're seeing the the humans who are working in it where we've created these jobs it really is fasc it's phenomenal uh looking seeing the products that we're building here and uh and thinking about the future and everything that we can do here it's just very exciting but the teams have done a good job getting us to this point we're excited about it we're we're obviously going to use this both domestically and for an export Hub so we think there's a bright future and a lot of Runway here well speaking of the runway uh Chuck this also coincides with the 10year anniversary of the making India campaign that was launched by the Modi government in 2014 now I want to understand from you both in terms of meeting domestic demand but more important in terms of exporting out of India what does the 5year trajectory look like yes so we have uh talked to the local team here and the the first product that we started is is geared towards uh the Telecom industry the service providers and and a large users of that product are here in India uh in in several months we will begin our first inter prise focused product and this is all on the journey to support the makan India initiative uh and serve the domestic par markets the best we can uh with h with this facility this is we're operating this facility at probably about 10% of what's possible so we have we have big plans ahead so you said that you're operating with 10% of capacity by when do you expect the next phase of your expansion to kickart I mean today is the inauguration of uh what is a multi-year investment plan that you've outlined but when do you believe that you will will uh Kickstart the second phase or the next phase as far as this plan is concerned yeah I just had this conversation with my team here that said that uh we'll we'll initiate the second product in this Factory in about six months in about six months you talked about domestic uh demand and the domestic Market uh chalk you're working with uh just about every Telecom service provider in the country you know take us through where things currently stand uh on that front how you see domestic demand you know of course 5G has taken off and now we've even got players like vone idea uh talking about their own 5G roll out Gio and bhy AEL have already uh done that uh take me through what you make of the India Telecom story today well it's it's an incredible story I just listened to the Telecom Minister actually take us through the history of the explosion of mobile phones the explosion of broadband and we all know the story uh of the uh explosion of the connectivity here in this country and I think that uh with the proac Ive effort of the government and what their desire is relative to their leadership in 5G and already contemplating the future with 6G uh research and development that's going on here uh I think that India has quickly become a leader in the Telecom industry around the world uh let's talk about export uh and exporting out of this facility uh for Cisco's Global markets Chuck how soon are you likely to proceed with your export plans and how large is the export aspiration out of India which are the markets that you're going to be exporting to well if you look at this first product that we uh we began manufacturing here this is the only facility globally that will be building this product so any country any customer in any country around the world uh we will be shipping a Made in India solution to them uh as we move forward you know the government has been great about working with us to expedite export licenses so that we could get active the entire business case that we made for manufacturing here was really highly dependent upon both serving the domestic Market as well as building a robust export capability so we plan on exporting products to countries all around the world obviously with a particular focus on Asia where it works and I think the real key is working with both the the state government and the union government around uh bringing the ecosystem of players here so that it just continues to become more cost effective effective and and a more attractive place for us to keep bringing our manufacturing could the more components and the more of our partners that are in our ecosystem that come here the better decision this is well you know and Chuck that's what I want to build on in terms of being able to create that ecosystem in uh uh India in Tamil Nadu around your facility uh you know uh take me through cost competitiveness and where things currently stand versus for instance the other markets that you have manufacturing facilities in Asia in uh what would the disadvantage be at this point in time uh and what do you believe the Improvement can be once the ecosystem starts being set up here yeah it's a great question so we made the decision knowing that it would be a little bit of a higher cost for us for input cost basically because of the transportation of components that uh aren't local yet but it's our belief uh first of all we believe that the government here is going to make every effort and will be successful in building a complete ecosystem so we decided to forward invest knowing that it's going to be a little more expensive uh we think by coming here uh we will actually help attract and help validate the business decisions of the component and other ecosystem Partners to come here if you think about this one product that we are building in this Factory it has almost 30 layers on the PCB assembly and over 10,000 individual components in a single product so there's a lot of opportunity I think by us coming here it opens up uh a lot of opportunity for the government to recruit some of these partners of ours and uh we're hopeful and we'll be at working proactively with the government to make the case for them to come here you know uh where are those conversations at Chuck in terms of bringing the component Partners the component ecosystem uh to India uh how soon do you believe we're going to see that shift happen and what would that mean I mean you're you're also making investments in markets like Taiwan in markets like Vietnam uh you know in terms of manufacturing uh in order for you to double down on your Investments here in India will that be a critical aspect to actually see the component ecosystem build out before you double down on your Investments here well I think we we had conversations today we've already seen some early movement of ecosystem Partners here uh and uh in the ICM space as an example and we had discussions today with the government officials here in the state about uh us working with them to proactively build a list of priority partners that we both want to actively recruit and uh and work on getting to come here so I think uh we have a high degree of confidence that it'll be successful uh we really don't have uh any of our future work here that's that's that's dependent upon that happening but I think the business case becomes more obvious to us when that does happen and that's what we're looking forward to uh you know Chuck this $1.3 billion annual revenue that you talk about on account of this first phase of your investment uh in India in this manufacturing facility uh if you can give me some idea of how much of this is going to be driven by domestic demand how much of it will be driven by your ability to export out of the country and potentially what could this 1.3 billion uh be over the next few years well right now we it it's obviously early so we'll have to see how the uh the breakdown of the domestic Demand versus the global demand uh plays out so we don't really have a firmed number on that yet uh but I think the um you know when you when you think about 1.3 billion in the context of our total revenue I think that gives you a sense of of the opportunity for us here so this is this is a very small uh beginning for us here in India and we look forward to bringing a lot more volume here over time well uh you know looking at the global picture chuck would you say that India is the bright spot today uh I mean it's a fairly volatile Market uh would you say that India is the bright spot it's the Silver Lining you know we've been here for 29 years and obviously we have a a very strong research and development presence here as well as some operations and so the manufacturing is is a natural next step for us uh I don't know that my team or I have ever been been uh as optimistic and excited about the opportunity in India uh we have uh over the last year we we open three data centers with three different Cloud solutions for the India market particularly and I think you'll see us continue to do that but we we actually have never been more excited about the opportunity in India than we are today well that's good to hear but let's talk about what's happening globally uh as far as Cisco is concerned Chu because it is a difficult environment as I pointed out uh uh you know you've marked your third quarter of a revenue Decline and you've seen a 6% drop in Revenue that's the first since covid uh you've also announced uh restructuring plan as as well as reallocation of capital uh you know take me through what the key headwinds are today and do you believe that there has been any relief across any of the challenging uh you know uh conditions that you've been speaking of if you go back to our last quarter's announcement and you look at the revenue it's it's uh it's really important to understand that the revenue numbers that we're dealing with we have one more quarter are compared against a year where we really resolve the entire supply chain backlog issu so the the revenue was actually inflated in the prior year so the comparisons are just going to be off we have one more quarter of that to deal with so we we think last quarter when we talked about our our organic product orders not including the Splunk acquisition we're up 6% we saw Enterprise recover uh I think we we began to to feel better about the demand around the world but it's clearly it's it's a volatile world with a lot of unknowns right now but uh we feel good about our portfolio uh we felt good about finally clearing the supply chain situation last quarter and we're looking forward to uh to getting back to some normal ordering and demand signals from our customers well yes I I think everyone's hoping for a normaly to return but you you talked about the spunk acquisition Chuck and that's a big one $28 billion acquisition uh that you've uh you've done uh we're hoping to add 4 billion in annual revenue to your 54 to 55 billion Revenue base uh uh you've also done a smaller one uh robust intelligence security startup uh is 2025 going to be a big year for m&a as well well I I leave the the Strategic options of for what our development team needs uh to them uh they bring them forward and they they talk through the the Strategic uh rationale for why they want to do those we're very happy with the Splunk acquisition you know if you think about it in a nutshell to to to be a great networking company you have to be a great security company to be a great security company you're going to have to be a great AI company and to be a great AI company you're going to have to be a great data company and we are the only company in the world that has all four of those and so we think that we're well positioned and we think if we need other assets to actually continue to build on those capabilities then we'll we'll make those decisions as necessary well Chuck uh you know potential for India from an m&a point of view you talked about data you talked about security and we've got a bunch of startups operating in that space is uh is is there anything exciting on that front from an India perspective the exciting thing on the startup front in India is that it's expanding rapidly and there is a lot of focus on the very areas that are important to us if my memory serves me correctly I think we've made five Acquisitions here and we have we launched a billion doll AI fund to actually invest in AI startups and I would suspect that there' be lots of opportunities here in India to to not only invest but potentially acquire uh when it makes sense you know you talked about AI Chuck so let's build a little bit on that what's the expectation now you know beyond this billion dollar fund that we'll look at invest in in AI related startups but outside of that what is the overarching AI thrust AI plan for Cisco likely to be how do you see demand shaping up uh what's the expectation and the estimate there yeah so on the AI front we're obviously building AI into all the products that we build today we we're leveraging it completely we're we're building natural language interfaces in all of our products through a uh unified assistant that we're building so if you look at our security platforms as an example you can actually use natural English language to to define a policy and have it automatically deployed uh we're also building infrastructure that will that is going under large language models for training both the networking infrastructure as well as Optics and then when you look at the Enterprise we're working and have announced uh infrastructure in the Enterprise space that is inclusive of Nvidia gpus third party storage as well as our networking security and and uh an orchestration layer uh that'll be available early in 20 25s to help our Enterprise customers uh deploy AI applications in a in a simpler way so there's lots of opportunity for us there's security uh and as I mentioned earlier and I think we're going to have to leverage AI the massive data sets that we have relative to threat intelligence we'll be applying AI to help our customers get to faster identification and resolution of security threats you know Chuck you said that you are hopeful that after the next quarter uh you know there will be a normaly as far as demand is concerned once the inventory issues are addressed but I want to understand from you I mean what we are seeing across the tech world at this point in time uh are restructuring announcements and that does involve laying off the workforce as well uh and Cisco has also done that two rounds of layoffs that you've announced do you believe that the worst is now behind us in terms of uh you know restructuring the workforce specifically and how much of this is linked to the difficult environment how much of this is linked to AI yeah it's um so it's it's it's never something that we want to do as you would expect but the announcement we made was largely around it is around Ai and security we needed to rapidly shift a meaningful number of of resources into uh AI infrastructure designing silicon for AI infrastructure uh cyber security AI applications Etc so for us it was more about a reallocation and really less associated with the macro environment TR my final question to you before I let you go you said you've never been more excited or optimistic about India uh so uh you know so so leave us with the big headline uh on what to your mind gives you the confidence about how India is shaping up both from a domestic point of view as well as now as you start manufacturing here from an export point of view well I think obviously the the aspirations and the plan that's being built to to get to the third largest economy in the world uh the focus on GDP growth here which then is fueled by building a manufacturing sector that includes exports which we're excited about and I have to say that uh proclivity for Action that I saw in all of our meetings with the government ministers and leaders anything that we need to help them achieve

       " \"they fought for space on your phones with their apps on your plates with their food delivery and increasingly your baskets with quick Commerce as well but now soon they will be fighting for your Capital because the sebbi has cleared swig's IPO papers we're talking about swiy versus zomato while it remains to be seen how this space pans out it's interesting that swig's drhp has now been made public enabling better comparison with zomato so just to tell you the key metrics so far they suggest that swig's food delivery business has reached turnaround stage instamart is in blinket with the latter growing much faster and zomato's operating metrics are far better than swiggy as of now so let's look in detail how the overall financials stack up for both this is for FY 24 where revenues being pretty similar 11,250 cross for swiggy zato was 12,000 cross the big change was in the operating front as well swiggy had an ABA loss of 2200 CR versus a zomato gain of 42 crw remember this was the time when zato was turning around as well and as a result of which zato made a profit of 351 cror versus a swiggy loss of 2,350 cror notice the Stark Divergence in the cash between the two if you look at the first quarter swig's Food business did better and as a result of which we saw a lot better operating performance than what it was for full f524 and zomato because it was on the way up saw a much better Improvement in ABA first quarter eitaa was 177 cror and the margins were 4.2% swigy losses were close to 544 crors and here's where the cash balance as well from 5,000 cror came down to 2,000 CR for swiy and zomato kept holding on to 12,500 CR of cash that they have on their books now here's where things get interesting let's look at both their business verticals in fy4 and the first quarter this is the food delivery business notice how they made a loss of 47 CR this is swiggy that I'm talking about on a gross order value of 24,000 CR zato had a cross water value of 32,000 CR and they made an adjusted eitaa of 9 912 CR remember the contribution margins for zomato at 6.9% much better than swiggy as well but swiggy turned around in the first quarter of fi25 where the adjusted abitar came in at 58 CR and remember this is an operating leverage heavy business this is likely to grow much faster contribution margins at 6.4% versus zomato 7.3% remember how zomato's margins moved much higher and now let's talk about quick Commerce that will be the real value driver for both these businesses we've seen the in the case of blinket over the last few months the valuation up surge but there's been a stark Divergence in growth and numbers for both blinket and instamart with the same number of active dark stores at the end of FY 24 blinket Revenue cross order value was 50% higher than that of instamart and that reflected in the latter's operating performance the contribution margin was 2% as against swig's minus 6% this enabled them to grow their stores much faster and bet on this come q1 fi25 the benefit of operating leverage helped both the companies but swig's quick Commerce business was still contribution margin negative and zomato doubled from 2% to 4% they've also increased their active dark stores to 639 versus just 557 and they have a promise of 2,000 in the next 18 months let's see what happens in terms of growth because swig's objects of the 3750 CR fresh issue include 1,000 CR commitment to at dark stores it would be very interesting to see where this goes in the age of zepto big basket and Flipkart minutes all of this boils down to price so mat currently has a market cap of 2 and a half lakh CR and projected growth of 32 to 35% on the top line over the next 3 years making it trading at around 12 times price to sales based on current valuations for 2E forward now assuming swig's growth is similar to zomato but we'll have to discount it for far lower market share and zato much better operating performance in blinket itself the multiple would be a discount to the tune of anywhere between 25 to 35% basis these scenarios the swiggy market cap could be closer to 1.6 lakh CR or $20 billion or if you give it a steeper discount close to around 17.5 billion and 1 and a half lakh CR market cap as well still higher than the last valuation round but a lot lower than zomato let's see how the operating performance and quick Commerce for swiggy pans out going forward [Music] hey thank you for watching this on CNBC TV8 hope you liked it for more such interesting news and updates follow CNBC TV8 on all the social media platforms\",\n",
